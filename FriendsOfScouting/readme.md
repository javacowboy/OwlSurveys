### Exporting from MLS and importing into Friends of Scouting

Here are instructions on exporting from MLS and importing in FOS.  

#### Create an MLS export:
* Attached is an MLS report template named "Friends of Scouting Export.mls".  Copy this to a thumb drive or download it from your email onto the clerks office computer.
* Login to MLS on the clerks office computer.
* Goto the "Custom Reports" section under "Reports"
* Click Import
* Select the "Friends of Scouting Export.mls" file mentioned in step 1.
* Save
* Find the new template/report in the list of custom reports.
* Click/select it and "Save To File"
This will create a file named "Friends of Scouting Export.csv".  Save this file or email it to yourself to work on at home.

#### Create a BSA/FOS import file:
* Save the "Friends of Scouting Export.csv" file to a computer that has Java installed.
* In the same folder as the csv file, save the FriendsOfScouting_1.0.jar file attached to this email.
* Double click the FriendsOfScouting_1.0.jar file to run the program.
* The program will read the Friends of Scouting Export.csv file and convert it to a file named: BSA Friends of Scouting Import.csv
* A log.txt file is also created.  You can open this file to make sure there were no errors running the program.
* You can also open the BSA Friends of Scouting Import.csv file to make sure the program converted the data properly.
* Login to the FOS website with the info emailed from the Stake.
* Click the "Import prospect list" link.
* Select the BSA Friends of Scouting Import.csv file. 
* Click Import (It may take a minute or so to upload)
